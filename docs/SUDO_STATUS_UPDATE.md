# Sudo Status Notification Update

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Feature:** Added sudo operation status to all notifications

---

## Summary

All Discord and macOS notifications now include a line indicating whether sudo operations were executed or skipped. This provides visibility into which operations required elevated privileges and helps users understand if password prompts were shown.

## Changes Made

1. **Success Notifications** (line 460-466)
   - Added sudo status line after cleanup message
   - Shows "Skipped (user idle)" or "Executed (casks & ghost healing)"

2. **Error Notifications** - Added sudo status context to all error messages:
   - **brew update failure** (line 394-395)
   - **brew upgrade formulae failure** (line 406-407)

## Benefits

1. **Transparency** - Users know when password prompts occurred
2. **Debugging** - Helps identify if issues are related to sudo operations
3. **Awareness** - Clear indication of what ran with elevated privileges
4. **Consistency** - All notifications include this information

---

## Testing

### Verified
- ‚úÖ All unit tests pass (24/24)
- ‚úÖ Success notifications include sudo status
- ‚úÖ Error notifications include sudo status
- ‚úÖ Display test created: `tests/test_sudo_status_display.py`

### Test Output
```bash
python3 tests/test_sudo_status_display.py
```

Shows all four notification types with proper sudo status formatting.

## Documentation Updates

1. **README.md** - Updated example notification to include sudo status
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Added "Sudo Status Notifications" section
3. **SUDO_STATUS_UPDATE.md** - This file (comprehensive change documentation)

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling for user_idle Variable

The `user_idle` variable is set early in the `main()` function's try block. For the unexpected error handler, we added protection:

```python
except Exception as e:
    try:
        sudo_status = "..." if user_idle else "..."
    except NameError:
        # user_idle not defined, error occurred before idle check
        sudo_status = "Sudo status unknown (error occurred during initialization)"
```

This ensures notifications always include sudo information, even if the error occurred before idle detection.

### Sudo Status Messages

**For Success:**
- Idle: "Skipped (user idle)"
- Active: "Executed (casks & ghost healing)"

**For Errors:**
- Idle: "were skipped (user idle)"
- Active (early): "would have been executed"
- Active (after ghost healing): "were executed for ghost healing"
- Active (during casks): "were executed for ghost healing & some casks"
- Active (partial): "may have been partially executed"
- Very early: "Sudo status unknown (error occurred during initialization)"

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully Compatible**

- No breaking changes
- Notification format extended (not changed)
- All existing functionality preserved
- Tests continue to pass

---

## Next Steps

**None Required** - Feature is complete and tested.

Optional future enhancements:
- Track which specific casks required sudo
- Add sudo operation count to logs
- Include sudo status in log file summary

**Implementation:** Complete
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Ready
**Tests:** ‚úÖ Passing
**Documentation:** ‚úÖ Updated
