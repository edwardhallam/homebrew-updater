```
✅ Homebrew update completed successfully!

📦 Upgraded: 5 formulae, 3 casks
```

## Badge Notification Fix (2025-10-09 Update)

**Issue:** Messages arrived but didn't trigger badge notifications (red number bubble)

**Fix:** Added `content` field to webhook payload alongside embeds

**Result:** Badge notifications now work! Discord now shows:
- Plain text content at top (triggers badge)
- Rich embed card below (detailed formatting)

**See:** `BADGE_NOTIFICATION_FIX.md` for complete details
