# Discord Webhook Issue - Resolution Summary

## üéâ Issue Resolved Successfully!

**Problem:** Discord webhook returning HTTP 403 Forbidden
**Root Cause:** Missing User-Agent header triggered Cloudflare bot protection
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - All tests passing

---

## What Was the Problem?

Your Discord webhook was returning:
```
HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
error code: 1010
```

This is **Cloudflare's bot protection** blocking requests that don't include a `User-Agent` header.

---

## The Investigation

### Diagnostic Approach

Created a comprehensive diagnostic tool (`tests/debug_webhook.py`) that tested:

1. ‚úÖ URL format validation
2. ‚ùå Simple requests (without User-Agent) - FAILED
3. ‚úÖ Requests with User-Agent header - WORKED!
4. ‚úÖ curl commands (includes User-Agent by default) - WORKED!

**Finding:** Requests without a User-Agent header were blocked by Cloudflare.

---

## The Fix

### Code Changes

**File:** `scripts/homebrew_updater.py`

Added `User-Agent` header to webhook requests:

```python
headers={
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'User-Agent': 'Homebrew-Updater/1.0 (Python)'  # ‚Üê Added this
}
```

Also fixed deprecation warning:
```python
# Before:
"timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()

# After:
"timestamp": datetime.now().astimezone().isoformat()
```

## What's Working Now

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Discord Webhook | ‚úÖ Working | All notifications sending |
| Idle Detection | ‚úÖ Working | Detects keyboard/mouse activity |
| Homebrew Updates | ‚úÖ Working | Formulae & casks |
| Ghost Cask Healing | ‚úÖ Working | Auto-removes broken casks |
| Log Management | ‚úÖ Working | Rotation working |

## Ready for Production

Your Homebrew updater is now **fully operational**:

‚úÖ **Scheduled:** Runs daily at 10:00 AM
‚úÖ **Smart:** Skips sudo casks when you're idle
‚úÖ **Clean:** Removes old installers and logs
‚úÖ **Notified:** Sends status to Discord
‚úÖ **Healthy:** Auto-heals ghost casks

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Check Your Discord Channel
Look for the 4 test messages that were just sent.

### 2. Monitor Tomorrow's Run
The script will run automatically at 10:00 AM tomorrow. You should see:
- üöÄ Start notification
- ‚úÖ Success notification with upgrade counts

### 3. Check Logs
After tomorrow's run:
```bash
ls -la ~/Library/Logs/homebrew-updater/
cat ~/Library/Logs/homebrew-updater/homebrew-updater-*.log
```

### 4. Manual Test (Optional)
To test right now:
```bash
# Trigger manually
launchctl start com.homebrew-updater

# Watch logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/homebrew-updater/launchd.out
```

## Files Changed

### Modified
1. `scripts/homebrew_updater.py` - Added User-Agent header
2. `tests/test_discord_webhook.py` - Added User-Agent header

### Created
1. `tests/debug_webhook.py` - Diagnostic tool
2. `WEBHOOK_FIX_REPORT.md` - Detailed investigation
3. `RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Technical Details

### Why Cloudflare Blocked Us

Discord uses Cloudflare for DDoS protection. Cloudflare's bot detection looks for:
- Missing User-Agent headers
- Suspicious request patterns
- Known bot signatures

Without a User-Agent, Cloudflare assumed we were a bot and returned error 1010.

### Why It Works Now

Adding `User-Agent: Homebrew-Updater/1.0 (Python)` makes the request look like a legitimate application, not a bot.
